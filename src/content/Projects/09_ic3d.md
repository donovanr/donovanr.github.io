# Integrated Cell 3D

We introduce a framework for end-to-end integrative modeling of 3D single-cell multi-channel fluorescent image data of diverse subcellular structures. We employ stacked conditional β-variational autoencoders to first learn a latent representation of cell morphology, and then learn a latent representation of subcellular structure localization which is conditioned on the learned cell morphology.

## Overview

The Integrated Cell 3D (IC3D) project develops deep generative models to understand and predict the spatial organization of subcellular structures in 3D. By learning a hierarchical latent representation of cell shape and organelle localization, we can:

- Generate realistic synthetic cells with biologically plausible organelle arrangements
- Understand the dependencies between cell morphology and organelle positioning
- Predict organelle localization patterns from cell shape alone
- Explore the statistical landscape of cellular organization

## Key Features

**Hierarchical Architecture**: Our model uses stacked conditional variational autoencoders (cVAEs) to capture the hierarchical nature of cellular organization:

1. First level: Learn cell morphology representation
2. Second level: Learn organelle localization conditioned on cell shape

**Multi-channel 3D Imaging**: The model handles complex 3D fluorescence microscopy data with multiple channels representing different subcellular structures.

**Interpretable Latent Space**: The learned latent representations are smooth and interpretable, enabling exploration of cellular phenotype space.

## Methods

We use β-variational autoencoders (β-VAEs) which balance reconstruction accuracy with latent space disentanglement. The conditioning mechanism ensures that organelle predictions respect the underlying cell morphology.

Key technical components:

- 3D convolutional encoder/decoder networks
- Conditional probabilistic modeling
- Spherical harmonic shape representations
- Multi-scale feature extraction

## Results

The model successfully learns to:

- Reconstruct diverse cell morphologies with high fidelity
- Generate realistic organelle localization patterns
- Capture statistical relationships between cell shape and organelle positioning
- Generalize to new cells not seen during training

## Impact

This work provides a computational framework for understanding the principles governing cellular organization in 3D space. It enables researchers to:

- Test hypotheses about structure-function relationships
- Generate synthetic training data for other analyses
- Identify abnormal cellular phenotypes
- Guide experimental design

The approach has been extended to study how cellular organization changes during differentiation and in response to perturbations.
