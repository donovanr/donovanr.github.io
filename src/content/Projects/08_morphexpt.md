# High Throughput Image Analysis Library

Foundational image / multimodal models are data hungry; to efficiently feed them with new data it's imperative to make data QC, collation, processing, analysis, and modeling as modular, performant, and painless as possible. A Python library with templated HPC workflows, a modular CLI, pre-prepared analysis notebooks, and import/export image QC enables rapid, reproducible, and verifiable microscope → knowledge distillation, as well as efficient data curation for training large foundational models.

## Motivation

Modern microscopy generates massive datasets:
- Terabytes of images per experiment
- Thousands of experimental conditions
- Multiple imaging modalities and timepoints
- Diverse cell types and perturbations

Processing this data requires:
- **Quality Control**: Automated detection of imaging artifacts and errors
- **Standardization**: Consistent preprocessing across experiments
- **Scalability**: HPC-enabled workflows for large datasets
- **Reproducibility**: Tracked, versioned, documented pipelines
- **Accessibility**: Easy-to-use interfaces for diverse users

## Solution

A comprehensive Python library providing:

### Core Components

1. **Modular CLI**: Command-line interface for common operations
   - Image ingestion and format conversion
   - Batch preprocessing and normalization
   - Feature extraction and analysis
   - Model training and inference

2. **HPC Workflow Templates**: Pre-configured for common cluster systems
   - SLURM, PBS, SGE job submission
   - Distributed processing with Dask
   - Containerized workflows (Docker, Singularity)
   - Automatic resource allocation

3. **Image QC Pipeline**: Automated quality assessment
   - Focus detection
   - Illumination correction validation
   - Artifact detection (debris, bubbles, edge effects)
   - Statistical outlier identification
   - Interactive QC dashboards

4. **Analysis Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for common analyses
   - Exploratory data analysis
   - Phenotype clustering and visualization
   - Statistical comparisons
   - Model evaluation and interpretation

5. **Data Curation Tools**: Prepare datasets for ML training
   - Balanced sampling strategies
   - Train/val/test splitting
   - Metadata management
   - Export to standard formats (HDF5, Zarr, TFRecord)

## Key Features
