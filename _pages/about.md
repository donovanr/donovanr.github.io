I work at the [Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence](https://allenai.org) on foundation models for biology and human health.

Previously, I was at [Novo Nordisk](https://www.novonordisk-us.com/about/who-we-are.html), training and applying multimodal biological foundation models to extracting knowledge from high dimensional experimental data.

Before that, I was a Sr. Modeling Scientist at the [Allen Institute for Cell Science](https://www.allencell.org/) and a postdoc at the [Institute for Systems Biology](https://www.systemsbiology.org/) with the [Hood-Price Lab](https://isbscience.org/people/labs/hood-price-lab/).

I went to grad school at [CMU & Pitt](http://www.compbio.cmu.edu/), where I was advised by [Dan Zuckerman](https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/departments/basic-science-departments/biomedical-engineering/bme-labs/zuckerman-lab/index.cfm), and worked with [Jim Faeder](http://www.csb.pitt.edu/Faculty/Faeder/), [Chris Langmead](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cjl/), [Markus Dittrich](https://bioteam.net/bio/markus-dittrich/), [Bob Murphy](http://murphylab.web.cmu.edu), and [Takis Benos](http://www.csb.pitt.edu/Faculty/benos/).
