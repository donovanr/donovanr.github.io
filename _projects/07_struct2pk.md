Accurately predicting half-life and clearance rate for monomer and multimer peptide / small protein therapeutics from historical data to reduce the need for pre-clinical animal trials. We use multitask Gaussian processes to leverage and factor all high dimension data relationships of interest, and make uncertainty-quantified predictions for novel molecular entities.
