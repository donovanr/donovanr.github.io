Foundational image / multimodal models are data hungry; to efficiently feed them with new data it's imperative to make data QC, collation, processing, analysis, and modeling as modular, performant, and painless as possible. A Python library with templated HPC workflows, a modular CLI, pre-prepared analysis notebooks, and import/export image QC enables rapid, reproducible, and verifiable microscope â†’ knowledge distillation, as well as efficient data curation for training large foundational models.
